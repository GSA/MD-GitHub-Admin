# MD-GitHub-Admin
Documentation on how the MD team can collaborate through GitHub

Git and GitHub can seem bewildering at first. This documenation will simplify and clarify common workflows and provide our team with a standard way of doing things. 

## Our Team
Our [team](https://github.com/orgs/GSA/teams/ogp-evidence-and-analysis) can give members [administrative, write, or read permissions](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-access-to-your-organization-s-repositories/). Even if you have `write` access into a repository, we strongly encourage the submission of pull requests for improvements or fixes.

Contractors or external government collaborators should only be added to teams with scoped write permissions to the respositories they're working on. They should never have administrative level rights. In order to separate out these permissions, create a team in the format of `projectname-admins` for government staff if necessary.

## READMEs
Two common ways to document a project are README files and wikis:
 - README files are a quick and simple way for other users to learn more about your work.
 - Wikis on GitHub help you present in-depth information about your project in a useful way.

It’s a good idea to at least have a README on your project, because it’s the first thing many people will read when they first find your work. You're actually reading this repo's README right now! So, when you create a new repository, select “Initialize this repository with a README” unless you plan to import an existing repository.

Within this repo, there's a [README_TEMPLATE.MD] that you can use to help get you started.

You can read more about creating a README or Wiki in the official GitHub documentation [here](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/).

## Contributing
To help your project contributors do good work, you can add a file called `CONTRIBUTING` (or `CONTRIBUTING.md` if you’re using Markdown) with contribution guidelines to your project repository's root, docs, or .github folder. When someone opens a pull request or creates an issue, they will see a link to that file.

Within this repo, there's a [CONTRIBUTING.MD] template that you can copy/paste into your new repo. **This document will be our teams canonical contributing guideline.**

You can read more about contributing guidelines in the official GitHub documentation [here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/).

## Issues
Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They’re kind of like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub’s tracker is called Issues, and has its own section in every repository.

Within this repo, there's an [ISSUES.MD] file with different issue templates. You can use these to [populate your repos with pre-built issue templates](Creating issue templates for your repository). 

You can read more about issues in the official GitHub documentation [here](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

## Project Boards
Project boards on GitHub help you organize and prioritize your work at a repository level. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs.

Project boards are made up of issues, pull requests, and notes that are categorized as cards in columns of your choosing. You can drag and drop or use keyboard shortcuts to reorder cards within a column, move cards from column to column, and change the order of columns.

Within this repo, there's a pre-built [project board] that you can [copy to your repo](https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-creating-new-boards-with-project-templates/).

You can read more about project boards in the official GitHub documentation [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/).

## License
The license on every repo must be Creative Commons 0, or CC0. That’s shorthand for Public Domain. MD should be committed to working in the public domain by our own policies even though that is also required by [law](https://www.usa.gov/government-works). 

Within this repo, there's a [LICENSE] file that you can copy into the root of your repos.
